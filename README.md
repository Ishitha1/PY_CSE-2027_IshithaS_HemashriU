# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Ticket Booking System (CLI)

A robust, console-based application built entirely using Python's standard library for managing flight schedules and passenger bookings. This system features distinct administrative and user workflows with persistent data storage via JSON files.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dual Access:** Separate menus for Admin (managing flights) and Users (booking/feedback).  
- **Data Persistence:** Uses local JSON files (`flights.txt`, `passengers.txt`, `users.txt`) for data storage.  
- **Robustness:** Implements extensive input validation and handles critical file access errors (like empty files or non-numeric input) without crashing.  
- **Clear Feedback:** Employs visual indicators (‚úÖ Success, ‚ùå Failure, ‚ö† Warning) for an intuitive command-line experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run

### Prerequisites
You only need **Python 3.x** installed. The project uses only the standard library (`os`, `json`, `time`).  

### Running the Application
1. **Save the Code:** Save the Python code as `airline_system.py`.  
2. **Execute:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the file's location, and run:  

```bash
python3 airline_system.py
````

The application will start, display the main menu, and automatically create the necessary data files upon its first run.
